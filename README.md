Universal Studio is one of the most popular amusement parks in the world. There are two
Universal Studios in the United States - Hollywood, CA and Orland, FL. Also, Universal Studio
expanded their business to Asia - Japan and Singapore. By reviewing customerâ€™s feedback regarding their
visit, the company will be able to understand what customers want and how they can improve for better
services.
The goal of the project is to perform sentiment analysis on Universal Studios reviews of different
branches and to find attributes that help understand why the customer liked or disliked the specific theme
park. Vader Sentiment Analyzer is used to classify the text into Positive/Negative reviews and TF-IDF is
used for Feature Extraction. Topic modeling performed to understand the top 10 important topics.

As a csv file is big, I couldnot attach it, so you can download at
https://www.kaggle.com/dwiknrd/reviewuniversalstudio. This dataset is reviews written by the
customers for their visiting experience over the years. This dataset contains 5000 reviews and has 6
attributes.
